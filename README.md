Tags: README# SearchSpring Snippets Gistbox
Included in this Gistbox are some snippets our team uses internally when 
implementing our AJAX Catalog v3 on our client's websites. We believe these
snippets may also be valuable to our partners when completing integrations
themselves.

We've grouped different componets of AJAX Catalog v3 Implementations into groups
in the left navigation.

# Working Locally
When working on a SearchSpring integration you do not have to work directly
in the SearchSpring Management Console, you can keep your templates and
JavaScript locally until you're ready to implement. Just see the
local-development files under AJAX v3 - Miscellaneous.
